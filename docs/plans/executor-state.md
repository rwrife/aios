- PR lane: 1 open PR at start.
  - Merged: https://github.com/rwrife/aios/pull/62 (squash, base `rwrife-scheduled-result-feedback`, build check SUCCESS, mergeable CLEAN; remote branch `rwrife-scheduled-jobs-release` deleted after merge).
  - Blocked PRs: none.
- Open issues: 26 at selection time; none assigned or PR-linked.
- Selected issue: https://github.com/rwrife/aios/issues/78 — "Download and use model button doesn't select the model".
  Rationale: the model picker is the first-run path to a working on-device chat
  model; a picker that misreports the active model directly breaks the AI-only
  setup flow, and the fix is fully verifiable headless (backend unit tests +
  real Qt qmltestrunner).
- Implementation: `apps/aios/local_models.py` exposes a `selected` flag derived
  from the configured `mode`/`model_path`; `apps/shell/LocalModels.qml` re-follows
  the configured model on inventory refreshes while preserving manual browsing.
- Verification:
  - Canonical Python unit tests: `tests.test_local_models` 12/12 pass.
  - Full python suite: 449 tests, 1 failure
    (`test_terminal_theme.test_desktop_launch_paths_use_the_themed_launcher`),
    which reproduces identically on `main` on this host (error overlap with
    changed paths is empty; classified as pre-existing baseline drift — the
    repo Validate workflow is currently red on main regardless).
  - QML harness (Alpine 3.23, Qt 6.10.3 `qmltestrunner`, offscreen software
    backend): `tst_local_models` 6 pass / 0 fail, with RED/GREEN proof (new
    regression test fails without the QML fix); `tst_chat_launcher` 16 pass;
    `tst_setup` 9 pass.
  - Not verified: in-VM QEMU GUI session (no display on this runner).
- New PR: (created by this run; see the final report)
